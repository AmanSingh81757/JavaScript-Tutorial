## PRINTING TO CONSOLE
- Basic printing the stuff on console:
```js
console.log("apple")
```

## VARIABLES
- a variable is a storage to contain data such as numbers strings etc
- We can create a variable using 3 types var, let, const
    - var means variable means we can change the value assigned and redeclare the variable any time
    - const means constant means we cannot redeclare and cannot change the value
    - let allows us to change the value of the variable but cannot redeclare the variable at ant time
- there are some reserved keywords which cannot be used to name a variable jsut like any other language
```js
var a = "apple" // value can be changes as well as redeclared
let b = "mango" // value can be changes further ahead
const c = "banana" // value doesnt change
var a = "kiwi"
b = "watermelon"
```
